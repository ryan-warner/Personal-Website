# Personal Website

A quick personal website for use with job applications, LinkedIn, and to generally represent myself online. 

Content is represented in a JSON, split out and passed as props in the respective react components for each section. 

## Site Header

Site header is made up of three layered gradients that rotate at random intervals and directions for each load of the page. The effect is an attempt to mimic a physical effect I saw online a few months back where gradients on glass cylinders were laid atop one another. 

It is possible that mobile devices show some artifacts of this composition when scrolling quickly to the top of the page.
